IMAGE OPTIMIZATION GUIDELINES

1. Resize images to max width of 2000px.
2. Save photos as JPG at 70–80% quality.
3. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., brook-trout-stream.jpg).
4. Add meaningful alt text:
   - Describe subject, environment, and mood.
   - Avoid keywords or stuffing.

Example alt text:
"Wild brook trout resting in shallow clear stream over gravel bottom"
