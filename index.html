<p>
Brook Trout Heaven is a personal and educational website dedicated to wild brook trout
and the cold, clean waters they depend on. This site reflects decades spent observing
northern rivers and lakes in Northwestern Ontario.
</p>

<p>
Brook trout are a measure of water quality and intact habitat. This site exists to document
their world and encourage respect for fragile cold-water ecosystems.
